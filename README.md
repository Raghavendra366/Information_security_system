My project is about blind sql injection.
-> In this project with the help of burp suite (a tool used for sql injection, testing etc..) and a test website Portswigger Web security academy, we can learn how to use blind sql injection to exploit the weakness of the website (like finding out admin password to login).
-> Steps to follow: 1) Install Burp suite or any similar tool.
                    2) Open test website through burp suite.
                    3) Find out loopholes any present (in this case loophole is present).
                    4) Then use blind sql injection to exploit the loophole logically.
